# dribbbleBOT.js is a console script that automatically likes dribbble shots.

1. Log in to dribbble
2. Get a random shot
3. Copy script from dribbbleBOT.js (I mean the text, not whole file)
4. Paste in browser's console (in Chrome hotkey is F12)
5. Press enter


dribbbleBOT gives a like and then move to the next shot. This process is repeated infinitely.

Added new feature - if dribbbleBOT or you already liked current shot, it goes to the next shot.
